            Hello everyone! My name is Bryan. I'm from Guatemala.
            I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology. 
            One of the things that I love to do is spend some good quality time with my family. 
            I also love sports and videogames. I've been married for 3 years now and have a son. I currently work at FamilySearch.
        </p>

            Some of the advantages from learning about careers in web design is that you can offer your services on that as a freelancer.
            In my case is also useful if you have a family business and you want to manage its website.
  
            I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was 8 years old and served a full time mission in Tempe, Arizona.
